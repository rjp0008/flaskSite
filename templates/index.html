                <p class="lead">Cleaning up this site.</p>
                <p> Posted on March 6, 2017 at 7:00 PM</p>
                <p>So this site is hosted on a flask server, specifically one of the many running
                    at <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com">pythonanywhere.com</a>.
                    It's been a great (and cheap) resource, but in tooling around and just doing things for fun has resulted in my folder
                    and file organization becoming a mess. All of my routes are in one main flask app, and the three projects
                    I have going are all over the place in that file.
                </p>
                <p>Another issue with my current development path is that not much of it is in source control. I was just tooling
                around with some basic stuff so I didn't think to bother with it. At this point though I think it's reached a
                point where I have to start organizing and using git like I know I should.</p>

                <p>Anyways my first task that gave me trouble is using css in this flask served webpage. I tried to create
                    a css file inside the static/css directory for my site. Specifically I was creating a codeblock class to use
                in posts. However flask was not happy with linking both bootstrap and my css file as shown below.</p>
       <script src="https://gist.github.com/rjp0008/cd3c463b6a26d0fecf04f408b2230fca.js"></script>
                <p>After reading some blog posts, and realizing this isn't an effort in web design, I decided
                to use githubs inline gists if I ever needed to inline code. I know I don't have an eye for visual design,
                so using out of the box solutions that look great is the best solution for me.</p>
                <p>The first refactoring effort I'm doing is to bring the intergraph endpoint into it's own file.
                I created this endpoint as one of the first slack custom addins I made for my team. It's purpose is
                pretty simple, it will return a random person on the team in a json formatted response. This
                ties into slacks webhoob functionality to give use a /random slash command in any slack channel. Mostly this
                is used to make someone finally getting around to doing a code review. There are some bonuses to the slash
                command though, it will remove the requester from the pool of output options, because you can't do your own
                code review. Also you can @tag or :emojii: tag people on the team to get them removed from the pool,
                if they've already done one of the reviews.</p>
                <p>In refactoring this slash command I've realized that now there is no way to arbitrarily choose any person on
                on the team. This is because the requester will always be excluded from the pool of options. The solution
                I came up with is to have two endpoints, a truely random person endpoint, and a code review endpoint. They are a
                'GET' and 'POST' http request on the perezdev.com/random/ url respectively. This was possible by marking the
                    specified route with an extra parameter 'methods=['GET', 'POST']'. The default for flask is to olny support
                    GET requests. I decided this distinction between GET/POST because you can either get any random person, or post data to the url that excludes team members.</p>

                <p class="lead">Starting a development blog for my adventures in coding and scripting.</p>
                <p> Posted on March 5, 2017 at 3:00 PM</p>
                <p>I finally decided to start a personal site after reading other people's and using them as very helpful resources.
                Hopefully something I post here will be as useful as the things I've read in the past.</p>
                <p>I expect many of my initial blog posts will be summations of the work I've already done as part of different sites hosted here.
                Most of this aforementioned work is only half completed or could be extended. Which is part of the reason I started this
                site, to create accountability and finish up some of these projects.</p>
